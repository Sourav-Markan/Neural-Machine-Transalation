# Implementation of NMT for English-Hindi 
I have implemented two models
1. Sequence to sequence model(Keras)
2. Sequence to sequence with alignment(Tensorflow)

NOTE: For Sequence to Sequence one has to download glove pretrained model obtained from: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ for English anf Hindi word embedding.
Further implemtation details given in Pdf.
